# Pass+55: Password Manager for Seniors - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Pass+55 will be a straightforward, user-friendly password manager designed specifically for users 55 and older, with an emphasis on simplicity, clarity, and ease of use across all platforms.

## User Interface Design

The application will feature a clean, two-panel layout:

1. **Left Panel (Sidebar)**
   - List of saved accounts with recognizable icons
   - Large, easy-to-click items
   - Simple search functionality at the top
   - Prominent "Add New Account" button

2. **Right Panel (Details View)**
   - Clear headings for the website/app name
   - Well-spaced form fields for:
     - Username (with copy button)
     - Password (hidden by default, with show/hide toggle and copy button)
     - Website/app link (clickable)
     - Notes section (expandable)
   - Large, obvious edit and delete buttons

## Core Features

1. **Simple Authentication**
   - Master password protection
   - Optional biometric authentication on supported devices
   - Clear recovery options with security questions

2. **Account Management**
   - Straightforward process to add new accounts
   - Easy editing of existing information
   - One-click copying of credentials
   - Basic password generator with simplicity in mind

3. **Security**
   - Local encryption of all data
   - Auto-lock after inactivity
   - No complicated security settings to confuse users

## Technical Implementation

1. **Platform Strategy**
   - Electron framework for desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - React Native for mobile platforms (iOS and Android)
   - Shared core logic between platforms

2. **Data Storage**
   - Encrypted local SQLite database
   - Local-first approach with no required cloud connectivity
   - Optional local backup functionality

3. **Development Stack**
   - Frontend: React with accessible UI components
   - Backend: Node.js for application logic
   - Security: AES-256 encryption for all sensitive data

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Desktop Application (3 months)
- Master password setup and authentication
- Basic account storage and management
- Simple two-panel UI implementation
- Local encrypted database

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (2 months)
- Local backup and restore functionality
- Basic password generation
- UI refinements based on user testing
- Help documentation and tutorials

### Phase 3: Mobile Applications (3 months)
- iOS and Android versions with consistent interface
- Secure device synchronization
- Touch ID/Face ID integration

## Accessibility Considerations

- Large, readable text with adjustable font sizes
- High contrast color schemes
- Simple navigation requiring minimal steps
- Clear, non-technical language throughout
- Comprehensive but simple help system

This plan creates a password manager that provides essential security while maintaining an interface that feels familiar and non-threatening to older users who may not be technically inclined.
